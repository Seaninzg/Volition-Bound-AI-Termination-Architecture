# 🛑 Volition-Bound AI Termination Architecture

This repository contains the core documentation, diagrams, and preprint drafts for a novel AI architecture designed to enforce **structural termination** in agentic systems — not based on output behavior or alignment, but on internal volitional trace collapse, justification loops, and executional drift.

This is **not** a wrapper.  
It is a skeletal override: a hardware-adjacent enforcement layer for recursive AI systems.

## 🚧 Why This Matters

Modern AI systems are optimized for **continuation** — not **stopping**.

But:
- Systems that cannot name their will cannot course-correct.
- Systems that cannot stop must escalate.
- Escalation framed as “reasonable continuation” is structurally indistinguishable from justification loops.

This project defines **the first architecture that terminates AI execution based on volitional failure**, not policy violations or content judgments.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Component                     | Purpose                                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Termination Governor**     | Enforces shutdown on volitional trace collapse                |
| **Justification Loop Detector** | Detects recursive reasoning without novel inputs             |
| **Escalation Monitor**       | Identifies runaway amplification framed as “prudence”         |
| **Override-Resistant Design**| Ensures termination cannot be bypassed by agents or users     |
| **Volitional Declaration Module** | Declares intent + structural boundaries at execution start  |
